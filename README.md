Analyzing messages in community forums using Natural Language Processing

This Notebook was used for the GDSC (Google Developer Student Club) Babcock Chapter's Semester Wrapped for members. A fun way for each member to know how active they were in the community forums.

## How to run

1. First export all WhatsApp chats.
2. Ensure that you place the exported chats in a folder called `chat-exports` in the same directory as the notebook
3. If you wish to change the directory of the exports, be sure to call the `read_files` function with the appropriate path or files directory
4. Run all the cells in the notebook.
5. You can take a look at some of the visualizations. The results will be exported to a file called `results.json`
